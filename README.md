LonelyCat
=========

Lonely, clunky, but does its job. Which is to pull new notifications
from your trello account (tied with your trello API_KEY + TOKEN),
and relay them to IRC channels.
A Trello board is mapped to an IRC channel.

## IRC and local interaction with the bot

The bot listens for commands on a local port, and also from a list of authorized nicks in IRC.

## Templates for notification types

Notification types which don't have a template are ignored.
Use it to filter out what you don't want to see.

## Status

It's broken for now (problem with fetching notifications). Don't use it.
